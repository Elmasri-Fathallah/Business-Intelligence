## SQL for Data Analysis - Project 3: Query a Digital Music Store Database
In this project, I had to query a digital music store database which holds information regarding the storeâ€™s media, employees, and customers. I used the database to help the store to gain understanding of the types of music that are purchased, where customers live, and how the company might optimize their business practices.
